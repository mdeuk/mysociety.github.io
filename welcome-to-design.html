        <h1>At mySociety, design is everyone’s responsibility</h1>
        <p>mySociety has a long history of transforming unfriendly digital systems into tools that are a pleasure to use. We’ve worked with governments, charities, big business and, of course, many partner projects around the world.</p>
        <p>We’re accustomed to taking complex interfaces, user irritants and poor design choices, and replacing them with a simple, usable online experience.</p>
        <p>We can do that because every member of our team brings a special combination of skills to the table: user research, data, their own expertise and industry best practices. You can talk to any member of our team about design matters, user research, or data gathering. Together, we can always find simple solutions for even the hardest of problems.</p>
        <p>Design is the application of research, user data, expertise and best practice, to reach an optimal solution to a problem.</p>
        <p>In that sense, every mySociety employee is a designer.</p>

        <p>We’re not doing it to be awkward – we’re doing it because years of experience has taught us that successful products are always rooted in a clear understanding of what the user really requires.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, we will always go back to your users. We’ll analyse real user data, conduct user research, or gather live user feedback to guide our decisions.</p>
        <p>Guessing or making decisions on the user’s behalf can sometimes feel like an efficient shortcut, but if not done very carefully, it can introduce risks and doubt into the development process, and cause problems further down the line.</p>
        <p>When there is uncertainty about the way forward, user research is always the right answer.</p>

<p><strong>Since nobody knows your users like you do, we’d appreciate your help in gathering this data.</strong></p>

<p>This might mean sharing website analytics, or helping us contact a sample of existing or prospective users. Maybe you already have research into your user base – let us know! Everything you can teach us about how your users act and think can help us build a better solution to their needs.</p>


<p><strong>Because design is about more than just making something look good or on-brand. It’s about how a website works and feels.</strong></p>
<p>We want to make a website that works and feels great for you and your users.</p>
<p>So let’s do this!</p>
